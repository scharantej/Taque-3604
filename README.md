## Solution: Flask Application for a Beautiful Landing Page for Cloud Tasks

### HTML Files

- **index.html:** This file will serve as the main and only page of the application. It will contain the HTML for the landing page, including the header, body, and footer.

### Routes

- **/:** The root route will render the `index.html` page. This route will be defined in the `app.py` file.

### app.py (Flask Application File)

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

### Instructions for Use

1. Create a new file named `app.py` and copy the code provided above into it.
2. Create a new directory to store your HTML files.
3. In the HTML directory, create a file named `index.html` and add the following HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Cloud Tasks Landing Page</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwF4tKIqpo0ao7Yรม7x87AzEk" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your landing page content here -->

  <!-- Example content -->
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Welcome to Cloud Tasks!</h1>
    <p>Cloud Tasks is a fully managed task queuing service that allows you to create, manage, and execute tasks. It's designed to handle large volumes of tasks efficiently and reliably.</p>
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks/">Learn More</a>
  </div>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyjoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

1. Run the application using the command `python app.py`.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view the landing page.

### Notes

- The `app.run()` method is set to run the application on port 8080 in debug mode. This can be changed to a different port or disabled for production use.
- The `index.html` file includes Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.
- The landing page content can be customized to meet your specific requirements.
